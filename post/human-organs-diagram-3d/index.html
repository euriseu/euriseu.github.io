Anime has been around since the late 1800s, and its history is nothing short ofLegend. Today, there are millions of fans across the globe who enjoy watching anime on TV or streaming services. While some may only be familiar with Japan&rsquo;s popular genre, others may have never heard of Studio Ghibli, creators of Spirited Away and Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle. Here are five key moments in the history of anime that will leave you wondering why it continues to grow in popularity today:</p><ol><li>In 1907, Japans born artist and illustrator Eisuke Matsubara drew the first manga-style animation for a film release. This was followed by many other studios throughout the 1930s and 1940s before Production I.G began releasing anime films in earnest in 1954.</li></ol><h2 id=image001>Image001<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#image001>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.med-health.net/images/10415905/image001.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.kkFFWTNcC-3uCJ5kWtpYhAHaMb&pid=15.1"' alt=image001><p><em>Source: med-health.net</em></p><blockquote><p>bones functions image001.</p></blockquote><p>When it comes to wallpaper, there are a few things that everyone should consider.
